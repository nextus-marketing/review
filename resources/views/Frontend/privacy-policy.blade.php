If you use this site, you understand and agree to the comparehomesecurity.net Privacy Policy in effect at the time of your use, and any other terms and conditions posted on the site. We hope that this disclosure will help increase your confidence in our products and services, and enhance your experience. Therefore, in compliance with industry standards and regulations enforced typically by federal and state governments, we abide by the following Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>Information Collection and Use
            This Privacy Policy applies to all users of our products and services ("Consumers"), including those who have used our website ("Web Site"), which is owned by Centerfield Media Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Owner"). Please note that this policy applies only to this Web Site, and services wherein comparehomesecurity.net determines the purposes or means of processing your personal information, and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link, or business partners to whom we provide your information, based on your requests as relating to the product or service in which you are interested, and for whom we serve as service providers. Alternatively, the information comparehomesecurity.net collects on behalf of a third party, to whom we provide marketing services, may be subject to both this Privacy Policy, and the third party's privacy policy. For more information on those companies or organizations' personal information practices, and your rights, please visit their respective privacy policies.
            </br></br>
            Personal information is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a natural person or household, such as a real name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, payment information, and account ID ("personal information"). When other information is directly associated with personal information, that information may also be considered personal information. Information that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized is not considered personal information. Publicly available information, as that information is defined by applicable law, also may not be personal information.
            </br></br>
            A subset of personal information we collect may be considered "sensitive personal information," as defined by applicable law, and includes the categories provided in the chart below.

        </ul>

 <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1.4s">Some of the personal information we collect, such as legally protected characteristics and health information, may be considered sensitive personal information under applicable law. When we collect or process sensitive personal information, we do so with your consent, or as permitted by applicable law.

  <p>To serve you more efficiently and effectively, we use "cookies" technology. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive that contains information about the user. Cookies are linked to particular devices over time, and may be linked to other personal information we obtain.</p>
  <p>Cookies enable a website to "personalize" itself for each user and reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer. In order to optimize your experience, cookies also help with the collection of customer tracking data. We may also capture customer tracking data on some of our partners' websites related to activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our website. This information is used to monitor the performance of our partners.</p>
  <p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.

An IP Address is a number used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>
  <p>Your browser or device may offer settings that allow you to choose whether browser cookies are set and to delete them.

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web users.</p>
  <p>We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section within any email you receive from us.</p>

  <h4 style=" margin-top:18px;">Telephone Calls and Recordings</h4>
